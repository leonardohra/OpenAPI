          This is email address determines where the invoices for all ShopAccounts
          in the same _external_user_id_ group are sent. Each time you create or
          update a ShopAccount for an _external_user_id_ and also provide
          __email__, the email destination for all the ShopAccounts in the
          _external_user_id_ group are updated at the same time.

          We suggest you provide an immutable email address. If your user can
          change the email address to which the invoices are to be sent, then you
          will need to do an update for one of the ShopAccounts for that user in
          order for Storecove to start using the new email address.

          Note that this field is mandatory for the first ShopAccount that you create for an entity.

          users can manage multiple organizations/administrations, then it is a
          better idea to put the organization/administration identifier in this
          field, because the _external_user_id_ groups the ShopAccounts into a set
          that all deliver their invoices to the same destination (typically an
          email address).
