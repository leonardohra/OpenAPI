The folder "APIS" contains all the YAMLs for APIs
Once you clone/download the repository, change the variable PATH_YAML in OpenAPI/main.py to wherever your "APIs" folder is.

## Running the program
Once you run main.py, the program should run (it takes a while) and it will print the main words for the generated topics (default = 3)
